# 🏥 Hospital Tender Management Platform

A role-based healthcare procurement management system designed to digitize hospital tender workflows, vendor coordination, and procurement analytics.

The platform centralizes tender lifecycle management and aims to evolve into a data-driven procurement intelligence system.

## 🚀 Vision

Hospitals often manage procurement using fragmented systems or manual processes.  
This platform provides a structured, secure, and scalable solution to:

- Manage tenders end-to-end
- Coordinate vendor bidding
- Compare bids intelligently
- Track procurement analytics
- Maintain audit-ready logs

Long-term goal: Build an intelligent procurement platform powered by analytics and predictive insights.
